celery needs to update each day at 00:00 every goal to set their
done_today atribute to false
and needs to create a dailygoal at 00:00 if it was not created??


maybe a day detail view would be good

metrics view in calendar and need to add images to frontend public
mnore styling


celery -A core beat --loglevel=info
elery -A core worker --loglevel=info
